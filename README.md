I have used Spring Boot as per requirement. I was using .jsp to implement the back end fully to incoperated with front end.
I was planning to attach .jsp and vue.js togeather but I was not able to complete the .jsp fully.
I have used MySQL for database becuase it is used by large tech companies and it is widely used as part of web development.
